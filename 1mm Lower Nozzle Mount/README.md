#1mm Lower Nozzle Mount

This Nozzle mount is the same as stock, except it's been thickened 1mm on the bottom. This has the effect of lowering the nozzle height by 1mm.

Why you ask?
I was having an issue where my IR probe part of the X carriage is about 0.1mm lower then the nozzle.... so I just decided that lowering the nozzle was the best solution
